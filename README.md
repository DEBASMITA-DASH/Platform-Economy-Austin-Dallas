Data Viz Project. Did exit of Uber/Lyft in Austin affect other industries in the area such as Restaurants?

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background of the Platform Economy & Business Problem 
In 2016, Uber and Lyft ceased operations in Austin following a local ordinance requiring 
fingerprint-based background checks for drivers. This regulatory change triggered a 12
month gap in ride-sharing services until statewide regulations allowed their return in 2017. 
The absence of these platforms disrupted mobility, potentially impacting local businesses like 
restaurants. 
1.2 Market Disruptions from Uber & Lyft's Exit 
• Uber and Lyft’s exit disrupted worker commutes, making travel difficult, costly, and time
consuming, particularly for late shifts or areas lacking public transport.  
• Reduced customer access due to the absence of convenient ride-sharing also led to fewer 
tips and lower earning potential for staff.  
• This dual impact affected both employee retention and restaurant operations.
